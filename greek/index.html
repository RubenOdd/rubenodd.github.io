            <p>Greek mythology is great way to see the way people thought and rationalized things back in the day. People always thought that there has to be something grander and bigger than them and seeing time of history when one specific (and boring) religion hasn't overtaken it yet. Boring, that is the best way to not describe what happens in Greek Mythology.</p>
